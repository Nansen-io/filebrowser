# Frontend

## CSS change

I need filebrowser GUI (this repo) to match the same colour scheme used here: `https://www.acorn.tools/login`

I will use --chrome option in claude code to enable the agent to inspect the CSS for filebrowser frontend which is usually accessed with `http://localhost:8080`

You should check recent commits in git to see what has been changed so far.
